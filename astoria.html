<p>One of the early settlers of Astoria in the 19th century was Heinrich Engelhard Steinway, who was the founder of the piano company <strong>Steinway & Sons</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the majority of Astoria's population was Greek, making it known as a "Greek neighborhood" to this day.</p>
<p>The Steinways built one of their first piano factories in Astoria.</p>
<p>Astoria is the home of <strong>Kaufman Astoria Studios</strong>, where many big-name movies and TV shows were filmed, including Men in Black III, Sesame Street, and Orange is the New Black</p>

<p>I was born in Manhattan but I spent my entire life (so far) in Astoria. I spent my entire life in the same house, but when I moved to college this past summer my parents moved out of my childhood home.</p>
